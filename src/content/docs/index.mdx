Welcome to the RCAC Bioinformatics Tutorials site! Your starting point for running bioinformatics tools efficiently on Purdue’s high-performance computing clusters.

This documentation hub offers:

- **Step-by-step guides** on using tools like Trinity, HiFiasm, BRAKER, and Juicer
- **Workflows for genomics and transcriptomics**, tailored to RCAC’s systems (Negishi, Bell, Gilbreth, etc.)
- **Best practices** for HPC job submission, resource optimization, and troubleshooting
- **Custom installation instructions** for commonly used software and environments

Whether you're a beginner exploring RNA-seq or an experienced researcher deploying large-scale genome assembly, this site is designed to help you get results faster and with fewer headaches.
