Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a widely used, lightweight IDE that supports remote development via SSH.
This makes it a convenient option for researchers less comfortable with terminal-only editors like Vim, especially when developing code or managing data on RCAC resources.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) locally

2. Install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension

3. Set up SSH keys on your local machine and upload your public key to the cluster

4. Configure your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) with RCAC cluster details

5. Connect to the RCAC cluster using VS Code's Remote - SSH

</Steps>

## Basic Setup

### 1. Install VS Code

- Download the installer for your operating system from the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation
- Launch VS Code after the installation is complete

### 2. Install Remote - SSH Extension

- Open VS Code
- Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side
- Search for "Remote - SSH" in the Extensions Marketplace
- Click "Install" to add the extension to your VS Code setup

### 3. Set Up SSH Keys

SSH keys allow you to connect to the cluster without entering a password each time. The setup differs slightly between operating systems.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux/macOS">

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash frame="none"
# Check if you already have SSH keys
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# If not, generate new SSH keys
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -C "pete@purdue.edu"
# Press Enter to accept the default file location
# You can leave the passphrase empty for convenience, or set one for extra security

# Copy your public key to the cluster
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pete@gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu

# Repeat for other clusters you use
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pete@negishi.rcac.purdue.edu
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pete@bell.rcac.purdue.edu
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">

**Option 1: Using PowerShell (Windows 10/11)**

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell frame="none"
# Check if you already have SSH keys
Test-Path ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# If not, generate new SSH keys
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -C "pete@purdue.edu"
# Press Enter to accept the default file location
# You can leave the passphrase empty for convenience, or set one for extra security

# Display your public key
Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the output, then SSH into the cluster and add it manually:

```powershell frame="none"
ssh pete@gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu
# Enter your password when prompted

# On the cluster, add your key
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
exit
```

**Option 2: Using Git Bash**

If you have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installed, open Git Bash and follow the Linux/macOS instructions above.

### 4. Configure SSH Config File

The SSH config file tells your system how to connect to each cluster. Open or create `~/.ssh/config` in a text editor and add entries for each cluster:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux/macOS">
The config file is located at `~/.ssh/config`
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Windows">
The config file is located at `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\config`
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash title="~/.ssh/config"
Host gautschi
    HostName gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu
    User pete
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host negishi
    HostName negishi.rcac.purdue.edu
    User pete
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host bell
    HostName bell.rcac.purdue.edu
    User pete
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

<Aside type="tip">
Replace `pete` with your Purdue career account username in all entries.

### 5. Connect to the Cluster

You can connect to the RCAC clusters using VS Code's Remote - SSH extension in several ways:

**Option 1: Remote Window Button**

Click on the blue button in the bottom-left corner of VS Code (shows `><` icon), select "Connect to Host...", then choose the cluster you want (e.g., `gautschi`, `negishi`, or `bell`).

![VS Code Remote SSH](/assets/figures/vscode-connect.png)

**Option 2: Command Palette**

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS), type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...", and select your desired cluster.

**Option 3: Remote Explorer**

Click on the Remote Explorer icon in the Activity Bar on the side, expand the "SSH Targets" section, and click on the cluster you want to connect to.

Once connected, you can open files, run commands in the integrated terminal, and manage your projects on the cluster directly from VS Code.


## Advanced Setup: Connecting to Compute Nodes

The basic setup connects you to a login node. However, you may want to connect VS Code directly to a compute node, for example:

- When running an interactive job and wanting to edit files on the compute node
- When using tools like [HyperShell](https://hyper-shell.readthedocs.io/) that track which compute node ran each task
- When debugging code that's running on a specific compute node

### Advanced SSH Configuration

This configuration enables automatic proxy jumping through the login node to reach compute nodes:

```bash title="~/.ssh/config"
# Connect to a specific login node for consistency
Host gautschi
    HostName login07.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu

# Proxy through login node to reach any compute node on Gautschi
Match host "!login*.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu,*.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu"
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p gautschi

# Common settings for all RCAC hosts
Match host *.rcac.purdue.edu
    User pete
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ServerAliveInterval 300
```

<Aside type="note">
**Order matters!** SSH processes the config file top-to-bottom and uses the first matching entry. The more specific rules must come before the general ones.
</Aside>

### How It Works

1. **Direct login node access**: `Host gautschi` pins you to a specific login node (`login07`) for consistent connections

2. **Compute node proxy**: The `Match` block with `ProxyCommand` automatically routes connections to compute nodes (e.g., `a123.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu`) through the login node

3. **Common settings**: The final `Match` block applies your username, SSH key, and keepalive settings to all RCAC hosts

### Using This Configuration

With this setup, you can:

- Connect to the login node: `ssh gautschi`
- Connect directly to a compute node: `ssh a123.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu` (automatically proxies through login node)
- Use VS Code to connect to either login or compute nodes
- Use `sftp` to transfer files from compute nodes: `sftp a123.gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu`

<Aside type="tip">
This is particularly useful with HyperShell. When you run `hs info <task_id> --stdout` on your laptop, it can automatically SFTP output files from the compute node that ran the task.
</Aside>

### Extending to Other Clusters

To add the same capability for other clusters, replicate the pattern:

```bash title="~/.ssh/config"
Host negishi
    HostName login01.negishi.rcac.purdue.edu

Match host "!login*.negishi.rcac.purdue.edu,*.negishi.rcac.purdue.edu"
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p negishi

Host bell
    HostName login01.bell.rcac.purdue.edu

Match host "!login*.bell.rcac.purdue.edu,*.bell.rcac.purdue.edu"
    ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p bell

# Keep the general RCAC match at the bottom
Match host *.rcac.purdue.edu
    User pete
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ServerAliveInterval 300
```


## Troubleshooting

### Connection Times Out

- Verify you're on the Purdue network or connected to the [Purdue VPN](https://www.purdue.edu/vpn/)
- Check that the cluster is not under maintenance at [RCAC Status](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/news)

### "Permission Denied" Errors

- Verify your SSH key is correctly added to the cluster:
  ```bash frame="none"
  ssh -v pete@gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu
  ```
  Look for lines mentioning your key file

- Check file permissions on the cluster:
  ```bash frame="none"
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

### VS Code Keeps Asking for Password

- Ensure your SSH key path in the config file is correct
- On Windows, make sure the path uses forward slashes or escaped backslashes:
  ```bash
  IdentityFile C:/Users/pete/.ssh/id_rsa
  # or
  IdentityFile C:\\Users\\pete\\.ssh\\id_rsa
  ```

### "Remote Host Identification Has Changed" Error

This can happen when cluster login nodes are updated. Remove the old key:

```bash frame="none"
ssh-keygen -R gautschi.rcac.purdue.edu
```

### Connection Drops Frequently

Add keepalive settings to your SSH config to prevent idle disconnections:

```bash frame="none"
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 300
    ServerAliveCountMax 2
```
