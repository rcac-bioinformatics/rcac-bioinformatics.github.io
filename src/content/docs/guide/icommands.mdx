CyVerse provides a cloud-based data store accessible via iRODS, allowing researchers to manage and transfer large datasets. From RCAC clusters (Negishi, Bell,  Anvil), you can authenticate with your CyVerse account and use iCommands to list, upload, or download files efficiently. 


<Aside type="note">
If you don't have a CyVerse account, you can sign up for a free account at [CyVerse User Registration](https://user.cyverse.org/).

## Setting up iRODS access to CyVerse

<Steps>
1. **Load the necessary modules**
   ```bash frame="none"
   module --force purge
   module load biocontainers
   module load irods
   ```

2. **Initialize your iRODS session**
   ```bash frame="none"
   iinit
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter the following:

   ```yaml frame="none"
   Enter the host name (DNS) of the server to connect to: data.cyverse.org
   Enter the port number: 1247
   Enter your irods user name: <CyVerse-Username>
   Enter your irods zone: iplant
   Enter your irods password: <CyVerse-Password>
   ```
   Enter your CyVerse password when prompted. The password is not displayed (you won't see `*` or `.` either). If successful, this creates or updates a configuration file (usually at `~/.irods/irods_environment.json`), enabling seamless use of other iCommands.
   
3. **Verify your iRODS connection**
   ```bash frame="none"
   ipwd
   ```
   This should return a path like:
   ```bash frame="none"
   /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>
   ```
   If these commands work and return expected output, your connection to CyVerse is successful and youâ€™re ready to transfer files.

</Steps>







## Transferring files between RCAC clusters and CyVerse

Once connected, you can use iRODS commands to move files between your RCAC environment (e.g., Anvil) and CyVerse Data Store. Below are the most common operations:

### List files and directories in your Data Store

```bash frame="none"
ils
```

You should see a listing of your CyVerse files and folders. Example output:

```
/iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>:
  C- /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/project1
  C- /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/raw_data
    data_summary.txt
```


### Upload a file from RCAC to CyVerse

```bash frame="none"
iput results.txt /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/
```

This command uploads the local file `results.txt` to your CyVerse home directory.

### Upload a directory (recursively)

```bash frame="none"
iput -r analysis_folder /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/
```

The `-r` flag allows you to upload entire directories.


### Download a file from CyVerse to RCAC

```bash frame="none"
iget /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/raw_data.fastq .
```

This downloads the file into your current working directory on the cluster.

### Download a directory (recursively)

```bash frame="none"
iget -r /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/project_folder .
```

This downloads an entire directory and its contents.


### Create a new directory (collection) in CyVerse

```bash frame="none"
imkdir /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/new_project
```

Organize your files by creating collections before uploading.


### Rename or move files within CyVerse

```bash frame="none"
imv /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/old.txt /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/archived.txt
```

This renames `old.txt` to `archived.txt` in place.


### Delete files or directories from CyVerse

```bash frame="none"
irm /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/unnecessary.txt
irm -r /iplant/home/<CyVerse-Username>/old_project
```

Use `-r` to delete directories. These operations are permanent unless your account uses trash recovery.
